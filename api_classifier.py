Classification rules:
1. Choose the MOST SPECIFIC category that best fits the article
2. If an article could fit multiple categories, choose the PRIMARY focus
3. If the article doesn't clearly fit any category, return "Uncategorized"
4. Pay attention to context - for example, "Higher Education" requires university/college context
5. "Administration" focuses on White House/Congress, not all government agencies
